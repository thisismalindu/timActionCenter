An alternative Action Center for all Windows Versions.

![This is how it looks like right now](https://i.imgur.com/mArR3Ix.png)

## Intro
I have made a few tools that just makes my life with Windows easier. One of them is called ProxyEnabler and it just sits on top of my screen and I can click ON or OFF to turn the proxy settings on and off. Sometimes I use a Proxy and sometimes I don't. So I need to have the ability to quickly do that. Like how you would turn Wifi On and Off in the Windows Action Center.

So it came to my mind, that there would be more stuff like this that other people would want too. So I wanted to take the challenge of creating a customizable "Action Center" with simple commands like this. 

This would stay in the tray icon just like how EarTrumpet works. I am using Winforms, so the UI won't look good as WinUI, but it will look quite good.

Oh, oh! it knows your System Accent Color too!
